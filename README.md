# Hangman

***

Hangman is a simple guess the word game.
The Player then has to guess the letters that could appear in a word.
If a letter occurs in the word, the program enters the letter in all positions.
If the letter is not part of the word, the guesser gets a penalty point.
The penalty points are indicated by drawing a hangman. \
If you have reached 12 penalty points the round is over and the next word will appear.
When all the words in the list have had their turn, you will get a summary of lost and won rounds.
